# DownloadYoutubeVid
Made a Java program to download music by reading a text document "MusicList.txt" found within the program folder. Utilizes Selenium to search for the video and to navigate through a 3rd party website to download the video.

To download your music, simply add the name of the YouTube video that you wish to download into "MusicList.txt". The program will download the music into the Downloads folder. Once the music has been downloaded, the name is erased from "MusicList.txt".

#Important
This program selects and downloads the first search result on YouTube. So make sure you're getting the right results!
Sometimes, the 3rd party website takes too long to convert the video into mp3. The program will eventually skip that video if that happens. Simply run the program again once it's done.
